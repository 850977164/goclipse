## MMRNMHRM release ChangeLog

### MMRNMHRM 0.0.x
 * More lenient with CDT versions. MMRNMHRM can now be installed with any CDT 8.x.x.
  * However, there is a small change using DDT with a version other than the recommned/tested one will break things. Each MMRNMHRM release will list a recommented/tested CDT version.
